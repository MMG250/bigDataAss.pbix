# bigDataAss.pbix
Power BI Dashboard for NYC Uber Fares Dataset
## 📊 Project Description

This project provides a data visualization and analysis of the *Uber Fares Dataset* collected in *New York City*. Using Microsoft Power BI, we explore how Uber rides vary by date, dispatch base, and day of the week. The goal is to extract actionable insights from the dataset using interactive visuals and dashboards.
